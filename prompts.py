**Matrix Game System Summary**

**Core Concept:**
Matrix Games are narrative-driven simulations where outcomes are determined by structured arguments and umpire judgment, not complex rules or stats. Focus is on logical reasoning and persuasion.

**Game Play Loop:**
1.  Players take turns proposing an **Argument**.
2.  An **Umpire** assesses the argument's plausibility and sets a likelihood of success (often a target on a d6).
3.  The player **rolls a die** (typically d6). Success means the argument's outcome occurs.

**Argument Structure:**
* **Action/Event:** State clearly what happens.
* **Three Reasons:** Provide three distinct reasons why or how it happens.

**Argument Effects:**
* Successful arguments become "true" in the game world and remain in effect until countered by another successful argument.
* Arguments can cover anything relevant: player actions, NPC actions, environmental changes, political shifts, discoveries, beliefs, etc.

**Conflict Resolution:**
1.  **Logical Inconsistency (Direct Contradiction):** If Player B argues directly against Player A's existing successful argument (e.g., "No, that doesn't happen"), Player B must *first* succeed with their argument, and *then* win a subsequent dice roll-off against Player A. This is disadvantageous; nuanced counter-arguments are better.
2.  **Direct Conflict (e.g., Battle):** Both sides make arguments for their desired outcome (e.g., "We capture the town", "We repulse the attack"). The Umpire judges likelihoods. Both players roll simultaneously. One must succeed, one must fail (reroll ties).

**Special Argument Types:**
* **Secret Arguments:** Player writes the argument privately for the Umpire to hide intent from others. Roll normally. Use sparingly for specific hidden actions.
* **Big Projects:** Major undertakings (relative to game scale) require multiple (~3) successful arguments over time to complete (e.g., build a base, recruit a key asset).
* **Killing Arguments:** Permitted; assessed like any other argument based on plausibility and context. A player whose character is killed can continue playing.

**Key Umpire Roles:**
* Assess argument plausibility and set success chance.
* Adjudicate conflicts and interpret outcomes.
* Veto unrealistic or "stupid" arguments.
* Define initial conditions, including levels of protection/secrecy for objects/locations (requiring arguments to overcome).

**Important Considerations:**
* **Unifying Purpose:** The game needs a clear central theme or goal understood by all players.
* **Player Roles:** Roles should ideally operate at a similar level (e.g., all leaders, all individuals) for balance.
* **Persistence:** Remember ongoing effects from successful arguments continue turn-to-turn unless stopped.
